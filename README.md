## SBC Branch

This branch contains the code for ports of headless EmuTOS to a few
68000 based single board computers (SBCs). The supported boards
include

- Bill Shen's [Tiny68K Rev 2](https://www.retrobrewcomputers.org/doku.php?id=boards:sbc:tiny68k:tiny68k_rev2)

- The [Rosco M68K Classic V2](https://rosco-m68k.com) board.

The features added in this branch relative to upstream EmuTOS include:

- Full support for the MC68681 Dual UART and modern variants like the
  XR68C681.  This includes interrupt-driven receive, flow control,
  `rsconf()` and `bconmap()` support.

- Fixes to support 8-bit IDE interfaces and IDE interfaces that do not
  support software reset.

- Changes to serial console mode to force 80-column mode.

- The ability to run the MC68901 MFP at triple speed.

- A preliminary attempt at a CMake-based build process.

### Building

To build the ROMs, you need to have the Atari ST MiNT cross tools
installed for your operating system. See
http://vincent.riviere.free.fr/soft/m68k-atari-mint/.  The tools will
need to be on your PATH.

You will also need [CMake](https://cmake.org) and
[Git](https://git-scm.com). Then follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone this repository with SBC ports.
git clone https://github.com/codesmythe/emutos.git

# Move into the emutos directory
cd emutos

# Change to the 'sbc' branch
git checkout sbc

# Create the cmake build directory and go there
mkdir build && cd build

# Run cmake to configure
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/toolchain.cmake ..

# Build the Tiny68K variant
# Other valid targets at the moment are `rosco_v2.bin` and `roberts7531.bin`
make tiny68k.bin
```

## README for EmuTOS

This release has been built on Linux Mint (a Ubuntu derivative), using
Vincent Rivière's GCC 4.6.4 cross-compiler.  The custom tools used in
the build process were built with native GCC 4.8.4.

The source package and other binary packages are available at:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/emutos/files/emutos/1.2.1/

An online manual is available at the following URL:
https://emutos.github.io/manual/

The extras directory (if provided) contains:

1.  One or more alternate desktop icon sets, which you can use to replace
    the builtin ones.  You can use a standard resource editor to see what
    the replacement icons look like. To use a replacement set, move or rename 
    the existing emuicon.rsc & emuicon.def files in the root directory, then 
    copy the files containing the desired icons to the root, and rename them 
    to emuicon.rsc/emuicon.def.

2.  A sample mouse cursor set in a resource (emucurs.rsc/emucurs.def).  This
    set is the same as the builtin ones, but you can use it as a basis to
    create your own mouse cursors. To use a replacement set, copy the files
    containing the desired mouse cursors to the root, and rename them to 
    emucurs.rsc/emucurs.def.

For further information on the above, see [doc/emudesk.txt](doc/emudesk.txt).
